You are given a table named repositories, format as below:

repositories table schema

project
commits
contributors
address
The table shows project names of major cryptocurrencies, their numbers of commits and contributors and also a random donation address ( not linked in any way :) ).

Your job is to remove all numbers in the address column and replace with '!', then return a table in the following format:

output table schema

project
commits
contributors
address
Case should be maintained.



In the above example, I have used Regexp_replace in which :


1) [[:alpha:]] matches any alphabets
2) [[:digit:]] matches any digits
 '' is the replacement string
 'g' instructs the function to remove all alphabets, not just the first one.
