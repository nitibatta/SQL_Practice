Simple group by query : 
Few things to keep in mind while using group by clause:
1) the fields that are in select statement must be included in the group by clause or should be used with aggregate functions.
2) We can exclude the ones that are in aggregate function to be in the group by clause.

Query: 
SELECT AGE,COUNT(NAME) AS people_count 
FROM people GROUP BY age;
