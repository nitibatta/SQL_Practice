 Create a FUNCTION: 
 
 Function to be created in postresql9.6 
 
CREATE FUNCTION INCREMENT(num INTEGER)
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
SELECT num =num+1;
$$ LANGUAGE SQL;

Another solution: Because the return type mentioned in the above solution is BOOLEAN which is wrong. It should be integer:

CREATE FUNCTION increment(value integer) RETURNS integer AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN value + 1;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
