To_tsvector: IS used to convert the field or table to vector which is easy to search. 
It ignores the conjuctions and the words that carry less meanings.
Then it gives the position number to each word in the vector by which it is easy to search the text.

To_tsquery: It is used to search for a word or phrase in the vector. 

Query: 
SELECT ID,PRICE,NAME 
FROM PRODUCT WHERE to_tsvector(NAME) @@to_tsquery('Awesome');
