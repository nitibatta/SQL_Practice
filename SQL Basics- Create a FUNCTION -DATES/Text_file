Instructions:
For this challenge you need to create a basic Age Calculator function which calculates the age in years on 
the age field of the peoples table.

The function should be called agecalculator, it needs to take 1 date and calculate the age in years according 
to the date NOW and must return an integer.

You may query the people table while testing but the query must only contain the function on your final submit.

people table schema
id
name
age


NOTE: Your solution should use pure SQL. Ruby is used within the test cases to do the actual testing.
