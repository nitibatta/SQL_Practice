For this challenge you need to create a SELECT statement, this SELECT statement will use an EXISTS to check whether a department has had a sale with a price over 98.00 dollars.

departments table schema
id
name
sales table schema
id
department_id (department foreign key)
name
price
card_name
card_number
transaction_date
resultant table schema

NOTE: Your solution should use pure SQL. Ruby is used within the test cases to do the actual testing.


Exists in sql:
The EXISTS operator is used to test for the existence of any record in a subquery.

The EXISTS operator returns true if the subquery returns one or more records.

EXISTS Syntax:

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE EXISTS
(SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition);
